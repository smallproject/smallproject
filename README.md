I'm a passionate Software Development student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in HBO-Software Development. I specialize in full-stack development with a growing focus on modern web technologies and practical software architecture.

I enjoy building meaningful digital solutions — from intuitive user interfaces to robust backend systems. Whether working on school projects, freelance work, or personal ventures like FutureSeed (a school management system), I’m always striving to learn, improve, and deliver clean, maintainable code.
